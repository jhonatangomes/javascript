# Contributing

This book series is now complete, **so in general, we're no longer open to contributions.**

## Translations

If you're wanting to translate these books, please keep in mind that any such translations **must be posted to this github repository, free and open, and not monetized.**

Foreign translations are appreciated, but only for the 3 second edition books.

**I will not be accepting any new foreign translations for previous editions.**

Please check these issues first:

To summarize, the steps for a foreign language translation are:

1. Fork this repo
2. Make your own translation entirely in your fork, preferably of all six books, but at a minimum of one whole book
3. File an issue asking for a branch to be made on our main repo, named for that [language's ISO code](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm)
4. Once the branch is created, you can PR to merge your translated work in
5. Once the merge is complete, I will promote you to a repository maintainer so you can manage any further translation maintenance work on your own branch of this repo

## Reading Experience (Chapter/Section links, etc)

I understand that reading one long .md file, with no relative cross links to other sections/etc, is not the preferred reading experience for most of you. As such, it's totally reasonable to want to file an issue/PR to add those kinds of features.

This topic has been brought up many times, and I've considered it. For now, I **do not** accept these kinds of changes into the repo.

The main purpose of my book repos is to track and manage the content for the purposes of publication (paid-for ebooks and print books). I do this in the open because I also care about providing free and early access to the content, to make sure there is no paywall barrier to learning.

As such, this repo **is not optimized for your reading experience.**

The intended **best reading experience** are the published books (either ebook or print), so I encourage you to purchase them for that purpose.

## Editions

The current (and final) edition of the books is the 2nd edition.

I **am not accepting any contributions** for 1st edition books, no exceptions.

## Typos?

We're not worried about typo fixes anymore. The books are done and published.

## Search First!

Seriously, no more need for contributions.

But, if you're going to attempt a contribution, please make sure to search the issues (both open and closed!) first.
